## Application Status

There is fair bit of infrastructure and functionality built into the front-end, and it can be cloned/downloaded and ran locally or you can visit my dev deployment at <a href='https://morning-dough.vercel.app'>https://morning-dough.vercel.app</a>. There is enough functionality to open this app as a user, explore the menu, and add items to 'My Bag'. The plan is the add much more functionality, such as authentication, POS, and overall full-stack functionality with a backend. The Java Sprint Boot backend is currently under development, and a Postgresql database is built.

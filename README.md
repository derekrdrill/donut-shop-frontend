Morning Dough üç©
A NextJS revamp of the front-end of Morning Dough, a donut shop prototype.

This is a fully adaptive/responsive application. The front-end infrastructure utilizes the following:

React Typescript
React Context
Material UI
Styled Components
Axios
Webpack
Jest
Enzyme
Application Status
There is fair bit of infrastructure and functionality built into the front-end, and it can be cloned/downloaded and ran locally or you can visit my dev deployment at https://morning-dough.vercel.app. There is enough functionality to open this app as a user, explore the menu, and add items to 'My Bag'. The plan is the add much more functionality, such as authentication, POS, and overall full-stack functionality with a backend. The Java Sprint Boot backend is currently under development, and a Postgresql database is built.

A list of the status of key tasks is below:
